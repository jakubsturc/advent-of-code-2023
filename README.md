# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

* I am starting to learn Go!  🐹
* Installing GoLand, thank you JetBrains for 30 day trial version. 💖

## Day 2:  Cube Conundrum

* I am getting into it. 💪
* GitHub Copilot is helping me a lot. 🤖

## Day 3:  Gear Ratios

* Omg. I am missing LINQ so much. 😥
* Copilot wasn't too helpful today. 🤷‍♂️
* My solution is neither elegant nor efficient.  But at least it's straightforward. Is this a Go! way? ❓
